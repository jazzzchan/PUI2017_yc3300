### For this Assignment 2, I received help from Unisse Chua, Rachel Lim and Yuwen Chang

## Process:
1. I mostly follow the professor's skeleton and Rachel's notebook for this assignment 
2. I used Rachel's code/method to download the dataset for this assignment and merge datasets as I kept having errors
3. I received help from Unisse Chua on data cleaning and mostly debugging problems
4. Instructor Christopher's code was used for extra credit.
