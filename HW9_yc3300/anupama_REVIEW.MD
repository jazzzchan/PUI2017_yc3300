### CLARITY: is the plot easy to read? is it clear or confusing, are the quantities being visualized ambiguous?
This plot is easy to read, the difference in color distinguishes the level of different natural gas consumption in New York City. But becasue she uses the term"quartile" instead of quantile, I was only expecting four colors (I think quartile supposed to represent 25%; 50%; 75% ; 100% of the distribution?). Therefore I am a bit confused by the color label which has five quartiles.  

### ESTHETIC: beautiful is a subjective judgment: you should not judge the plot on the basis of whether you think it is "beautiful", but you should judge whether its esthetic is functional to what it is meant to communicate. Are the colors chosen appropriately? Are the graphical elements used appropriate to represent the quantities being visualized? Are the graphical choices allowing you to focus on the right elements or are they distracting you?

This plot used yellow and green to show difference in different quartile category. However, for certain groups of people who cannot tell 
green and yellow apart (though I am not sure the level of brightness will be affective), they may have trouble telling what quartile those
areas belong to. On top of yellow and green, she also uses grey, which for color blinded it's can be hard to tell between yellow and green. 

### HONESTY: is the plot honestly reproducing the data or is it deforming it, perhaps to emphasize a point?
The plot honestly reproduce the data without emphasizing any point.
